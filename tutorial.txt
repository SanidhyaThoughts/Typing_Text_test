You never did tell me how many copper pennies where in that jar; how come?
Caught between a rock and a hard place.
Closing the barn door after the horse escapes.
Just staying one day ahead of yesterday.
Lie down with dogs and wake up with fleas.
The sharper the berry, the sweeter the wine.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
